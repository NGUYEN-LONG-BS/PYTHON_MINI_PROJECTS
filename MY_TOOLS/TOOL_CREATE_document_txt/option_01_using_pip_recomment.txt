Option 1: Use pipreqs
The easiest and most reliable way to generate a requirements.txt file is to use the pipreqs library. 
It scans your project for imports and creates a requirements.txt file automatically.

step 01: Install pipreqs:
pip install pipreqs

step 02: Run pipreqs, navigate to your project directory and run:
pipreqs . --encoding=utf8 --force
